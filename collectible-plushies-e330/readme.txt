V.1.0

This datapack adds collectible plushies via textured player heads to loot tables and a new plush trader villager. loot tables should be the same as vanilla, but with a chance for plushies to appear alongside the normal loot

This datapack is unlikely to be compatible with other data packs that replace loot tables. There's nothing that can be done about this.

An update with advancements is in the works.

How to play:

40 Plushies can be found in many places where you can find loot chests and gotten from the plush trader villager. Some are much rarer than others and not all can be found in the same environments.

To get a plush trader villager, you must use a nametag to rename a villager to "plush". The plush trader cannot be turned back to a normal villager. It uses the loom as a workstation and behaves no differently than a normal villager.

If you would like a complete list of give commands for every plush, see the "commands" file.
